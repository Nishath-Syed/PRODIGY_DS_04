# Data Science Internship Task 4: Analyzing and Visualizing Sentiment Patterns in Social Media Data

## Overview

This project involves analyzing and visualizing sentiment patterns in social media data to understand public opinion and attitudes towards specific topics or brands. The primary objective is to derive actionable insights from sentiment analysis and present these insights through various visualizations.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this analysis is `twitter_training.csv`, which includes social media posts and their corresponding sentiment labels.

## Task Description

The main objectives of this task are:

## 1. Data Preparation
   - **Load the Dataset**: Import the `twitter_training.csv` dataset into a Pandas DataFrame to facilitate analysis.
   - **Inspect the Data**: Review the dataset's structure and content to understand its features and target variable.
   - **Handle Categorical Variables**: Convert categorical variables into numerical formats if necessary to prepare them for analysis.
   - **Preprocess Text Data**: Ensure that the text data is clean and formatted correctly for sentiment analysis.

## 2. Sentiment Analysis
   - **Calculate Sentiment Scores**: Use the VADER sentiment analysis tool to derive sentiment scores from the text data. The sentiment scores quantify the emotional tone of each social media post.

## 3. Visualization
   - **Sentiment Distribution**: Create a plot to visualize the distribution of different sentiment labels across the dataset. This visualization helps in understanding the overall sentiment balance.
   - **Sentiment Scores by Category**: Generate a boxplot to visualize the sentiment scores across various categories. This visualization reveals how sentiment varies among different categories.
   - **Distribution of Sentiment Scores**: Plot a histogram of sentiment scores to understand the overall sentiment trends and distribution in the dataset.

## Steps Implemented

## 1. Import Necessary Libraries
   - Libraries for data manipulation (Pandas), sentiment analysis (NLTK), and visualization (Matplotlib and Seaborn) are used to support data analysis and visualization tasks.

## 2. Load and Inspect the Dataset
   - The dataset is loaded into a DataFrame, and its structure is inspected to understand its columns and the first few rows of data.

## 3. Preprocess the Data
   - Text data is cleaned and converted to a suitable format. Missing values are handled to ensure the data is ready for sentiment analysis.

## 4. Sentiment Analysis
   - Sentiment scores are calculated for each post using the VADER sentiment analysis tool, which provides a compound score reflecting the overall sentiment of the text.

## 5. Visualization
   - **Sentiment Distribution**: A count plot is created to visualize the distribution of sentiment labels.
   - **Sentiment Scores by Category**: A boxplot is generated to show how sentiment scores vary across different categories.
   - **Distribution of Sentiment Scores**: A histogram is plotted to display the distribution of sentiment scores, with an optional Kernel Density Estimate (KDE) for a smoother visualization.

## Results

### Sentiment Distribution

The sentiment distribution plot provides insight into the balance of different sentiment labels in the dataset, indicating the proportion of positive, negative, and neutral sentiments.

### Sentiment Scores by Category

The boxplot for sentiment scores by category shows how sentiment varies among different categories, highlighting any notable differences or patterns.

### Distribution of Sentiment Scores

The histogram of sentiment scores offers a view of the overall sentiment trends and distribution, helping to identify the general sentiment landscape within the dataset.

## Libraries Used

- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **NLTK**: For performing sentiment analysis using the VADER tool.
- **Matplotlib**: For creating visualizations of sentiment distribution and other plots.
- **Seaborn**: For enhanced visualizations and plotting capabilities.
